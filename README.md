This is not the full Project like as in the production link.I accidently deleted the full version from my system but had already hosted it online,this version however provide all the basic functionality .Some things it doesnot provide like as in the production website are mainly the frontend stuff like lazy-loading,spinner , some toasters .... those stuff.You need to create a link from prisma accelerate for the database pooling and put it in wrangler.toml file along with the jwt secret and put the actual database link in .env file. Some technologies this project use are :
: 1.**Prisma**(pg) 2.**Hono**(for backend) 3.**React** 4.**Tailwind**
The common package can be found in npm at @billu123/common-medium
